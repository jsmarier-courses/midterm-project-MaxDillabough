## Max Dillabough Midterm Project: READEME.md Section
My data came from a modified CSV file taken from Open Ottawaâ€™s data set, 2024 Service Requests. My usage of the data was carried out through methods discussed in class, such as the VIMO method, the use of functions like `SPLIT`, and help from outside tools like Open Refine. I believe my pie charts and use of my pivot table are prime examples of my thought process when tackling a section head on. I think my work was self explanatory and my story thorough. I am happy with the outcome of my assignment.
